        <p><strong>Created:</strong> 1952</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong>
          <br> Reflections of Chaos by Liana Torres is a powerful exploration of the human condition in the aftermath of World War II. Created in 1952, this monochromatic piece delves into themes of trauma, dislocation, and survival. Torres, a prominent European abstract artist, was heavily influenced by the war's impact on her native city. Her works often mirror the disintegration of society and the struggle to rebuild both physically and emotionally.
            
            In Reflections of Chaos, jagged shapes overlap and collide, embodying the chaos and fragmentation of that time. Torres’s distinctive use of sharp contrasts and dark shadows creates a sense of depth and movement, drawing viewers into an emotional landscape where despair and resilience coexist. Each form in the painting seems to represent fragments of human experiences—pain, hope, and the undying will to survive.
            
            The artwork’s abstract style reflects the growing trend in the 1950s toward non-representational art, allowing viewers to interpret their own meanings. Torres believed in art as a means of confronting harsh truths, and this painting serves as both a catharsis for her own experiences and an invitation for viewers to confront theirs. Through Reflections of Chaos, Torres reminds us of the complex journey from destruction to recovery, a theme still resonant today.</p>
